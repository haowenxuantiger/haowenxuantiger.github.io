1. Independently developed a heuristic feature engineering system based on Genetic Programming, and accomplished the time series prediction project based on LightGBM for the minute-level return data of SSE 50 Index. 
1. Optimized the factor preprocessing algorithm and hyperparameter tuning algorithm based on TA-Lib and UltraOpt, which reduced computation complexity significantly. 
1. Independently developed a single-subject longitudinal factor analysis system with parallel computing strategy, realized functional modules such as model training, position mapping, single-factor backtesting, risk indicator measurement, etc.
