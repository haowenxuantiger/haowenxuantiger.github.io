Hi, this is Wenxuan! Currently, I am an MEng student at Cornell University, majoring in Financial Engineering. Before that, I graduated as a Bachelor of Science in Finance & Mathematics at Renmin University of China. I love programming, especially the application in quantitative trading and research. I am familiar with Python, C and C++. This summer, I will work as a full-time quantitative research intern at Wolfe Research, LLC. 

During my spare time, I love sprint and body building (Runner-up of Men's Fitness Group B in the 17th Fitness Competition of Capital College of Higher Education). Plus, I'm a huge fan of music and I've achieved the 9th grade granted by Central Conservatory of Music in piano and the 10th grade granted by Central Conservatory of Music in clarinet.
